	abstract = {Thanks to a reasonable cost and simple sample preparation procedure, linear MALDI-ToF spectrometry is a growing technology for clinical microbiology. With appropriate spectrum databases, this technology can be used for early identification of pathogens in body fluids. However, due to the low resolution of linear MALDI-ToF instruments, robust and accurate peak picking remains a challenging task. In this context we propose a new peak extraction algorithm from raw spectrum. With this method the spectrum baseline and spectrum peaks are processed jointly. The approach relies on an additive model constituted by a smooth baseline part plus a sparse peak list convolved with a known peak shape. The model is then fitted under a Gaussian noise model. The proposed method is well suited to process low resolution spectra with important baseline and unresolved peaks.},

	abstract = {A generalized procedure for evaluating the accuracy and precision of mass measurements is described. A large, statistically significant number of mass spectra of a test compound, typically perfluorotributylamine, are acquired using a high resolution mass spectrometer. The mass measurement errors for a subset of the ionic fragments from the test compound are rigorously evaluated using statistical techniques. The results thus provided are a quantitative documentation of mass spectrometer performance. Experimental and theoretical statistical considerations are explored to refine the methodology into a general technique. Application of the method to the determination of the effects of various operating parameters such as choice of test compound, scan rate, magnet reset time, and peak intensity is demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Natural gas production is associated with emissions of several trace gases, some of them classified as air toxics. While volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have received much attention, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can also be of concern due to the known health impacts of exposure to this hazardous air pollutant. Here, we present quantitative, fast time-response measurements of H2S using proton-transfer-reaction mass-spectrometry (PTR-MS) instruments. An ultra-light-weight PTR-MS (ULW-PTR-MS) in a mobile laboratory was operated for measurements of VOCs and H2S in a gas and oil field during the Uintah Basin Winter Ozone Study (UBWOS) 2012 campaign. Measurements of VOCs and H2S by a PTR-MS were also made at the Horse Pool ground site in the Uintah Basin during UBWOS 2013. The H2S measurement by PTR-MS is strongly humidity dependent because the proton affinity of H2S is only slightly higher than that of water. The H2S sensitivity of PTR-MS ranged between 0.6–1.4 ncps ppbv−1 during UBWOS 2013. We compare the humidity dependence determined in the laboratory with in-field calibrations and determine the H2S mixing ratios for the mobile and ground measurements. The PTR-MS measurements at Horse Pool are evaluated by comparison with simultaneous H2S measurements using a PTR time-of-flight MS (PTR-ToF-MS) and a Picarro cavity ring down spectroscopy (CRDS) instrument for H2S / CH4. On average 0.6 ± 0.3 ppbv H2S was present at Horse Pool during UBWOS 2013. The correlation between H2S and methane enhancements suggests that the source of H2S is associated with oil and gas extraction in the basin. Significant H2S mixing ratios of up to 9 ppmv downwind of storage tanks were observed during the mobile measurements. This study suggests that H2S emissions associated with oil and gas production can lead to short-term high levels close to point sources, and elevated background levels away from those sources. In addition, our work has demonstrated that PTR-MS can make reliable measurements of H2S at levels below 1 ppbv.},

PTRwid is designed for a comprehensive evaluation of whole laboratory or field-based studies. All processing runs autonomously, and entire laboratory or field campaigns can, in principle, be processed with a few mouse clicks.  Unique features of PTRwid include (i) an autonomous and accurate mass scale calibration, (ii) the computation of a "unified mass list" that – in addition to a uniform data structure – provides a robust method to determine the precision of attributed peak masses, and (iii) fast data analysis due to well considered choices in data processing.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The Kathmandu Valley in Nepal suffers from severe wintertime air pollution. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are key constituents of air pollution, though their specific role in the valley is poorly understood due to insufficient data. During the SusKat-ABC (Sustainable Atmosphere for the Kathmandu Valley–Atmospheric Brown Clouds) field campaign conducted in Nepal in the winter of 2012–2013, a comprehensive study was carried out to characterise the chemical composition of ambient Kathmandu air, including the determination of speciated VOCs, by deploying a proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS) – the first such deployment in South Asia. In the study, 71 ion peaks (for which measured ambient concentrations exceeded the 2σ detection limit) were detected in the PTR-TOF-MS mass scan data, highlighting the chemical complexity of ambient air in the valley. Of the 71 species, 37 were found to have campaign average concentrations greater than 200 ppt and were identified based on their spectral characteristics, ambient diel profiles and correlation with specific emission tracers as a result of the high mass resolution (m ∕ Δm  {\textgreater}  4200) and temporal resolution (1 min) of the PTR-TOF-MS. The concentration ranking in the average VOC mixing ratios during our wintertime deployment was acetaldehyde (8.8 ppb)  {\textgreater}  methanol (7.4 ppb)  {\textgreater}  acetone + propanal (4.2 ppb)  {\textgreater}  benzene (2.7 ppb)  {\textgreater}  toluene (1.5 ppb)  {\textgreater}  isoprene (1.1 ppb)  {\textgreater}  acetonitrile (1.1 ppb)  {\textgreater}  C8-aromatics ( ∼ 1 ppb)  {\textgreater}  furan ( ∼ 0.5 ppb)  {\textgreater}  C9-aromatics (0.4 ppb). Distinct diel profiles were observed for the nominal isobaric compounds isoprene (m ∕ z  =  69.070) and furan (m ∕ z  =  69.033). Comparison with wintertime measurements from several locations elsewhere in the world showed mixing ratios of acetaldehyde ( ∼  9 ppb), acetonitrile ( ∼  1 ppb) and isoprene ( ∼  1 ppb) to be among the highest reported to date. Two "new" ambient compounds, namely formamide (m ∕ z  =  46.029) and acetamide (m ∕ z  =  60.051), which can photochemically produce isocyanic acid in the atmosphere, are reported in this study along with nitromethane (a tracer for diesel exhaust), which has only recently been detected in ambient studies. Two distinct periods were selected during the campaign for detailed analysis: the first was associated with high wintertime emissions of biogenic isoprene and the second with elevated levels of ambient acetonitrile, benzene and isocyanic acid from biomass burning activities. Emissions from biomass burning and biomass co-fired brick kilns were found to be the dominant sources for compounds such as propyne, propene, benzene and propanenitrile, which correlated strongly with acetonitrile (r2 {\textgreater} 0.7), a chemical tracer for biomass burning. The calculated total VOC OH reactivity was dominated by acetaldehyde (24.0 \%), isoprene (20.2 \%) and propene (18.7 \%), while oxygenated VOCs and isoprene collectively contributed to more than 68 \% of the total ozone production potential. Based on known secondary organic aerosol (SOA) yields and measured ambient concentrations in the Kathmandu Valley, the relative SOA production potential of VOCs were benzene  {\textgreater}  naphthalene  {\textgreater}  toluene  {\textgreater}  xylenes  {\textgreater}  monoterpenes  {\textgreater}  trimethylbenzenes  {\textgreater}  styrene  {\textgreater}  isoprene. The first ambient measurements from any site in South Asia of compounds with significant health effects such as isocyanic acid, formamide, acetamide, naphthalene and nitromethane have been reported in this study. Our results suggest that mitigation of intense wintertime biomass burning activities, in particular point sources such biomass co-fired brick kilns, would be important to reduce the emission and formation of toxic VOCs (such as benzene and isocyanic acid) in the Kathmandu Valley.},

The relative ease of sample preparation, the ability to quantify metabolite levels, the high level of experimental reproducibility, and the inherently nondestructive nature of NMR spectroscopy have made it the preferred platform for long-term or large-scale clinical metabolomic studies. These advantages, however, are often outweighed by the fact that most other analytical techniques, including both LC-MS and GC-MS, are inherently more sensitive than NMR, with lower limits of detection typically being 10 to 100 times better. This review is intended to introduce readers to the field of NMR-based metabolomics and to highlight both the advantages and disadvantages of NMR spectroscopy for metabolomic studies. It will also explore some of the unique strengths of NMR-based metabolomics, particularly with regard to isotope selection/detection, mixture deconvolution via 2D spectroscopy, automation, and the ability to noninvasively analyze native tissue specimens. Finally, this review will highlight a number of emerging NMR techniques and technologies that are being used to strengthen its utility and overcome its inherent limitations in metabolomic applications.},

Omics techniques provide a more holistic molecular perspective of studied biological systems compared to traditional approaches. However, due to their inherent data differences, integrating multiple omics platforms remains an ongoing challenge for many researchers. As metabolites represent the downstream products of multiple interactions between genes, transcripts, and proteins, metabolomics, the tools and approaches routinely used in this field could assist with the integration of these complex multi-omics data sets. The question is, how? Here we provide some answers (in terms of methods, software tools and databases) along with a variety of recommendations and a list of continuing challenges as identified during a peer session on multi-omics integration that was held at the recent ‘Australian and New Zealand Metabolomics Conference’ (ANZMET 2018) in Auckland, New Zealand (Sept. 2018). We envisage that this document will serve as a guide to metabolomics researchers and other members of the community wishing to perform multi-omics studies. We also believe that these ideas may allow the full promise of integrated multi-omics research and, ultimately, of systems biology to be realized.},

              Downsizing and compatibility with MEMS silicon foundries is an attractive path towards a large diffusion of photoacoustic trace gas sensors. As the photoacoustic signal scales inversely with the chamber volume, a trend to miniaturization has been followed by several teams. We review in this article the approach initiated several years ago in our laboratory. Three generations of components, namely a 40 mm
              3
              3D-printed cell, a 3.7 mm
              3
              silicon cell, and a 2.3 mm
              3
              silicon cell with a built-in piezoresistive pressure sensor, have been designed. The models used take into account the viscous and thermal losses, which cannot be neglected for such small-sized resonators. The components have been fabricated either by additive manufacturing or microfabrication and characterized. Based on a compilation of experimental data, a similar sub-ppm limit of detection is demonstrated. All three versions of photoacoustic cells have their own domain of operation as each one has benefits and drawbacks, regarding fabrication, implementation, and ease of use.},

          , 
            
              Multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) applied to hyperspectral Raman imaging is extensively used to spatially and spectrally resolve the individual, pure chemical species within complex, heterogeneous samples. A critical aspect of performing MCR-ALS with hyperspectral Raman imaging is the selection of the number of chemical components within the experimental data. Several methods have previously been proposed to determine the number of chemical components, but it remains a challenging task that if done incorrectly, can lead to the loss of chemical information. In this work, we show that the choice of ‘optimal’ number of factors in the MCR-ALS model may vary depending on the relative contribution of the targeted species to the overall spectral intensity. In a data set consisting of 27 hyperspectral Raman images of TiO
              2
              polymorphs, it was observed that the more dominant species were best resolved with a parsimonious model. However, species with intensities near the noise level often needed more factors to be resolved than was predicted by standard methods. Based on the observations in this data set, we propose a new method that employs approximate reference spectra for determining optimal model complexity for identifying minor constituents with MCR-ALS.},

	abstract = {For more than 30 years now, Independent Components Analysis (ICA) has been used to unmix complex signals. ICA was developed in the field of telecommunications, and its use has now extended to different domains including signal treatment, chemometrics, metabolomics, etc. The main interest of ICA is that it aims to extract “source signals” and their proportions from mixtures, which means that the resulting components are easier to interpret. In analytical chemistry, different instrumental methods and even wet chemistry methods yield sets of values that may be considered as analytical signals. ICA has been shown to be appropriate to identify the independent sources which are mixed together in unknown proportions in these signals, as well as their relative proportions. This chapter will present ICA, and different algorithms used to calculate its parameters, with focus on the Joint Approximate Diagonalization of Eigenmatrices algorithm. Different applications of ICA in analytical chemistry, based on signals coming from a range of sources such as fluorescence spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance,… will show how source signals related to components or phenomena present in the analyzed samples can be identified.},

Some of the most popular instrumental platforms will be covered in this chapter: liquid chromatography coupled with multiwavelength diode array detection (LC–DAD), gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC–MS), comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography with DAD (LC×LC–DAD), and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC×GC–TOFMS). Since these instruments are commonly applied to study complex samples, the resulting data are also very complex, and analyte peaks commonly overlap. Chemometric methods are often used to mathematically resolve (or unmix) the overlapped analyte peaks, which leads to successful analyte identification and quantification. The design and implementation of a particular instrumental platform can significantly impact various underlying aspects of the data structure, whether second order or third order, causing benefits and challenges for chemometric methods. The benefits and challenges that appear at the interface between hyphenated chromatography and chemometrics will be explored for several mathematical resolution methods, including multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS), generalized rank annihilation method (GRAM), and parallel factor analysis methods (PARAFAC and PARAFAC2).},

	abstract = {Obtaining a correct resolution of a chemical problem with multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) highly depends on the use of the appropriate constraints. With an increasing complexity of the data handled in analytical spectroscopy, as, e.g., hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data, new constraints might be necessary to encode spatial and spectral information on the mixture components. We therefore present in this chapter a constraint that exploits signal characteristics in order to impose smoothness of the MCR-ALS components. The proposed approach relies on the use of P-splines and can be applied to one-dimensional signals, such as concentration profiles and spectra, or two-dimensional signals, such as concentration distribution maps. Within this chapter, the concept of smoothness is explained, as well as a background on the method used for smoothing signals. Additionally, if the smooth character of a signal can be used as a constraint in MCR-ALS, we can also consider the rough character of a signal to be constrained. It is introduced how the constraint is implemented within the MCR-ALS framework, supported by simple simulated examples to illustrate the flexibility and viability of the constraint. The last section presents two case studies. One example deals with ultrafast time-resolved absorption spectroscopy data and the other with HSI data. In both applications, applying the smoothness constraint resulted in some improvement of the solutions obtained.},

	abstract = {A novel ion source based on direct current (d.c.) discharge has been developed for proton transfer reaction ionization operated at relatively high ion drift tube pressure. The shape and geometry of the ion source are designed to maximize overall ion intensity and to minimize interference from sample air. The initial performance of the technique, including speciation and intensity of reagent ions, their stability, and the impact of artifact signals, is evaluated by means of a proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOFMS) newly built in our laboratory. Intensities of the hydronium (H3O+) ions are typically (5–7) × 105 counts for a 1-min integration time with a duty cycle of ∼1\%. The fluctuations of the ion signals over a period of hours are within 4\%. Although the formation of artifact ions from sample air (NO+ and O), which react with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and subsequently cause fragmentation, is observed as background signals in addition to hydronium and mono- and di-hydrate H3O+ ions, intensities of both NO+ and O ions are only ∼0.5\% of those of H3O+ ions. Using our PTR-TOFMS system at a drift tube pressure of ∼5 Torr, the detection sensitivities are significantly improved and the detection limits for propene, acetaldehyde, acetone, isoprene, benzene, toluene, and p-xylene are estimated to be at the sub-ppbv level for 1-min integration.

The instrument is designed to be operated with a hollow cathode discharge ion source and an ion drift tube at relatively high pressures. Each component of the system, an ion source, a drift tube, an ion transfer region, and a time-of-flight mass spectrometer, are in detail characterized by a number of laboratory experiments. The optimized instrumental configuration enables us to gain high intensities of hydronium (H3O+) ions, typically ∼7×105 counts for 1-min integration at a drift tube pressure of ∼5Torr. It also suppresses background signals, and interferences from sample air (NO+ and O2+), which undergo fast reactions with volatile organic compounds, to ∼0.5\% of those of H3O+ ions. We find that the use of the custom-built discharge source show higher overall sensitivities than of a commercially available radioactive source. Potentials to detect oxygenated VOCs (aldehydes, ketones, and alcohols), halocarbons, and amines are also suggested. The detection limits for acetaldehyde, acetone, isoprene, benzene, toluene, and p-xylene were determined to be at the sub-ppbv levels for a 1-min integration time. A good linear response at trace levels is certified, but slight sensitivity dependency on water vapor contents is revealed. We finally demonstrate that the instrument can be used for on-line monitoring to detect large variations from emission sources in real-time.},

The reagent ion source uses a low-pressure discharge. The FIMR consists of a glass tube with a resistive coating, mounted inside a radio frequency (RF) quadrupole. The axial electric field is used to enhance ion collision energies and limit cluster ion formation. The RF field focuses ions to the central axis of the reactor and improves the detection efficiency of product ions. Ion trajectory calculations demonstrate the mass-dependent focusing of ions and enhancement of the ion collision energy by the RF field, in particular for the lighter ions. Product ion signals are increased by a factor of 10 when the RF field is applied (5000–18 000 cps ppbv–1), improving measurement precision and detection limits while operating at very similar reaction conditions as traditional PTR instruments. Because of the high water mixing ratio in the FIMR, we observe no dependence of the sensitivity on ambient sample humidity. In this work, the Vocus is interfaced to a TOF mass analyzer with a mass resolving power up to 12 000, which allows clear separation of isobaric ions, observed at nearly every nominal mass when measuring ambient air. Measurement response times are determined for a range of ketones with saturation vapor concentrations down to 5 × 104 μg m–3 and compare favorably with previously published results for a PTR-MS instrument.},

Spectral mixture analysis (or spectral unmixing) is a key processing step which aims at identifying the spectral signatures of these materials and quantifying their spatial distribution over the image. The main purpose of this chapter is to introduce the spectral unmixing problem and to discuss some linear and nonlinear models and algorithms used to solve it. We will show that, capitalizing on several decades of methodological developments in the geoscience and remote sensing community, most of the unmixing algorithms proposed to unmix remotely sensed images can be directly applied in the chemometrics field to process hyperspectral data arising from various scanning microscopic techniques such as scanning transmission electron microscopy and Raman imaging.},

	abstract = {Resolving Spectral Mixtures: With Applications from Ultrafast Time-Resolved Spectroscopy to Superresolution Imaging offers a comprehensive look into the most important models and frameworks essential to resolving the spectral unmixing problem—from multivariate curve resolution and multi-way analysis to Bayesian positive source separation and nonlinear unmixing. Unravelling total spectral data into the contributions from individual unknown components with limited prior information is a complex problem that has attracted continuous interest for almost four decades.

Spectral unmixing is a topic of interest in statistics, chemometrics, signal processing, and image analysis. For decades, researchers from these fields were often unaware of the work in other disciplines due to their different scientific and technical backgrounds and interest in different objects or samples. This led to the development of quite different approaches to solving the same problem. This multi-authored book will bridge the gap between disciplines with contributions from a number of well-known and strongly active chemometric and signal processing research groups.

Among chemists, multivariate curve resolution methods are preferred to extract information about the nature, amount, and location in time (process) and space (imaging and microscopy) of chemical constituents in complex samples. In signal processing, assumptions are usually around statistical independence of the extracted components. However, the chapters include the complexity of the spectral data to be unmixed as well as dimensionality and size of the data sets. Advanced spectroscopy is the key thread linking the different chapters. Applications cover a large part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Time-resolution ranges from femtosecond to second in process spectroscopy and spatial resolution covers the submicronic to macroscopic scale in hyperspectral imaging.},

Whereas its applications became widely used in our daily life; such as mobile conversation, video conferences, and other distant communications. These sorts of applications may suffer from what is well known the cocktail party problem. Independent component analysis (ICA) has been extensively used to overcome this problem and many ICA algorithms based on different techniques have been developed in this context. Still coming up with some suitable algorithms to separate speech mixed signals into their original ones is of great importance. Hence, this paper utilizes thirty ICA algorithms for estimating the original speech signals from mixed ones, the estimation process is carried out with the purpose of testing the robustness of the algorithms once against a different number of mixed signals and another against different lengths of mixed signals. Three criteria namely Spearman correlation coefficient, signal to interference ratio, and computational demand have been used for comparing the obtained results. The results of the comparison were sufficient to signify some algorithms which are appropriate for the separation of speech mixtures.},

	abstract = {For those chemical compounds absorbing in the UV–Vis region and not readily applicable to routine mass spectrometry ionisation methods, liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detection is a convenient platform to perform metabolite profiling. Data processing by hand is labour-intensive and error prone. In the present study a strategy based on multivariate curve resolution, and its implementation in an R package called alsace are described. The final result of an analysis is a table containing peak heights or peak areas for all features of the individual injections. The capabilities of the software, providing elements such as splitting the data into separate, possibly overlapping time windows, merging the results of the individual time windows, and parametric time warping to align features, are illustrated using a cassava-derived data set.},

	abstract = {La production de lavande concoure au rayonnement de la région Rhône-Alpes. Les applications de l’huile essentielle (HE) de lavande reposent sur la culture de 3 espèces (L. aangustifolia, L. latifolia et L. stoechas et d’un hybride L. x intermedia) aux chémotypes marqués. Le genre Lavandula est un modèle idéal pour comprendre la structuration et l’origine de la diversité des composés organiques volatils (COV) en particulier des terpènes. Les lavandes ont l’avantage d’avoir une aire de distribution large avec des régions bioclimatiques différentes, un nombre d’espèces limité (39) ayant des caractéristiques morphologiques et écologiques variées. Pour caractériser la diversité des COV accumulés dans les espèces du genre et envisager leur évolution, nous avons analysé (GC-MS) les COV de 29 espèces (certaines pour la première fois). Comme souvent chez les plantes, la production de COV dans les inflorescences de lavande est soumise à une régulation spatio-temporelle. L'émission différentielle de COV au cours du temps chez L. angustifolia a été relevée par les agriculteurs qui ont observé une qualité d’HE différente suivant la maturité des inflorescences au moment de la récolte. Pour modéliser ces variations et les corréler avec des étapes du développement de la plante, nous avons analysé, au niveau chimique (GC-FID) et moléculaire (qPCR), les variations temporelles des principaux COV dans les feuilles et les inflorescences (plusieurs années et cultivars). En amont de ces recherches sur les COV du genre Lavandula, différent outils de bioinformatique ont été développés. En particulier, le module « MSeasy » qui permet d’automatiser le rapatriement de données de GC-MS. Ceci constitue un pré-requis pour utiliser la lavande comme modèle d’étude des COV chez les Lamiacées},
